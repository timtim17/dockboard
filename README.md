# Dockboard: Dock + Dashboard

A small project to show the time on a "docked" phone, without having a real dock (i.e. Pixel Stand).

In theory this app would run while the phone charges on a stand (I have a small 3D printed one), and offer a nice
dock-like experience.

## Future Plans

- Have the app start and stop automatically while charging
- Have settings to toggle different options
    - Change background style (animation or dark)
    - Seconds on/off
- Widgets
    - Control audio playing on the device
        - Preferably any possible audio source, i.e. Spotify, Google Play Music, Pocket Casts
    - Weather display
    - Modularity: Provide some code and a layout, it'll fit into the app layout.
